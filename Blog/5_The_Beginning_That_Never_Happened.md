## Introduction: Why We Obsess Over Beginnings

That line sounds harsh, but it’s not meant as an insult. It’s frustration - and maybe a little honesty.
Humans are obsessed with how things begin. Every culture, every faith, every scientific theory tries to explain where it all started. Who made the universe? Why are we here? What came before everything else?

We keep asking those questions because we hate not knowing. We want to believe that if we could just figure out the first cause, everything else would make sense - purpose, morality, life, death. But maybe that’s the problem. Maybe the need for a “beginning” is the trap.

## Religion’s Version of the Beginning

Every religion has its own creation story.
One said, God spoke and light appeared.
Another said, God woke up and dreamed the world into being.
And the other said, God simply willed existence into motion.

These stories are powerful - they gave people a sense of meaning when science didn’t exist. But they also simplified the mystery of existence into something emotionally manageable. A beginning makes us feel safe. It gives us direction, a moral reason for being here.

The issue is that these stories claim certainty about something no human could possibly have witnessed. They’re explanations built on faith - and that’s fine, unless we mistake them for truth.

## Science Steps In - and Makes the Same Mistake

Science replaced mythology with math, but it still chases the same question: how did everything start?
The Big Bang theory says the universe expanded from a tiny, dense point about 13.8 billion years ago. That’s not a guess - it’s supported by cosmic background radiation and how galaxies move apart.

So far, so good. But then comes the next question: what caused the Big Bang? What was before it?

And that’s where even science hits a wall.
Time itself seems to have started with the Big Bang, so asking “what came before” might not even make sense. It’s like asking, “What’s north of the North Pole?”

The truth is, no one knows. Physics breaks down at the point of “t = 0.” Some scientists propose ideas like multiple universes, quantum fluctuations, or eternal cycles of expansion and collapse. But those are theories - educated guesses at best.

Religion fills that gap with God. Science fills it with models. Both are trying to explain something that might not be explainable.

## Maybe the Question Is Wrong

What if asking “How did it begin?” is the wrong question entirely?

We think of time as a straight line - with a start, middle, and end. But what if it’s not?
Some physicists say time might be an illusion, that everything - past, present, future - exists at once. Others talk about cyclic universes that keep collapsing and restarting forever.

If that’s true, then “the beginning” isn’t a single moment. It’s a pattern that’s always been happening. There was never nothing - just endless transformation.

In that case, religion isn’t just wrong about how it started. It’s wrong to assume there was a start.

## Why We Need a Beginning Anyway

It’s not just religion or science that wants a first cause - it’s human psychology.
We want to believe someone or something is in control. If there was a first cause, maybe there’s a purpose. Maybe life means something more than a cosmic accident.

But the idea of no beginning - no script, no author - scares us. It means there might not be a plan. It means we’re not the center of the story.

Still, that doesn’t have to be depressing.
If existence has no fixed start or purpose, then it’s up to us to create meaning. That’s real freedom - not waiting for divine instructions, but realizing we’re part of something that’s always been unfolding.

## Living Without an Origin Story

Let’s imagine accepting that there might not be a first moment.
What changes?

You stop worrying about where it all began - and start paying attention to what’s happening now.
You realize that every breath, every thought, every tiny change is part of the same ongoing process the universe has been doing forever.

You don’t need to believe in a “creator” to feel awe. The fact that matter from dying stars became you is awe enough. The fact that consciousness can even ask these questions is miraculous on its own.

Meaning doesn’t have to come from a divine plan. It can come from awareness - from recognizing that you’re not separate from the universe. You’re part of it, made of the same stuff, running on the same energy.

## Where Science and Religion Actually Meet

Both science and religion eventually reach the same limit - a place where words and equations stop working.

The religious call it mystery.
Scientists call it the unknown.

Neither can fully explain why there’s something instead of nothing. And maybe that’s okay.
Maybe the point isn’t to solve it but to live within it - curious, humble, and aware that whatever “beginning” there was (or wasn’t), we’re inside it right now.

Every second the universe keeps expanding, reality keeps rewriting itself. The beginning isn’t in the past - it’s continuous.

## Conclusion: The Beginning That Never Ended

Religion tried to answer how it all began - and got it wrong because it wanted certainty where there isn’t any. Science is smarter, but it still chases the same kind of answer, just in numbers instead of verses.

Maybe there was never a single starting point. Maybe “the beginning” isn’t something that happened once - it’s something that keeps happening.

The real shift comes when you stop asking, how did it start?
and start asking, how can I live while it’s still unfolding?

Because the beginning isn’t behind us.
It’s right now.
